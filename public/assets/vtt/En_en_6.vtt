00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.806
Once the target has been identified, the next

2
00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.354
step is to craft the perfect phishing email.

3
00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:17.114
Let's dissect the anatomy of these emails,

4
00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:21.054
revealing the sinister techniques employed by cyber

5
00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.394
criminals to manipulate and deceive.

6
00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:27.038
Phishers employ familiar looking email ids to

7
00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.918
lure unsuspecting victims into their traps.

8
00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:33.042
By spoofing or mimicking legitimate email addresses of

9
00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:36.426
trusted entities such as banks, companies, or even

10
00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:39.402
acquaintances, phishers aim to instill a false sense

11
00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:42.274
of trust and legitimacy in their targets.

12
00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:45.290
Since the subject line is what the receiver's eyes go

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.974
to first, it has to pique curiosity or invoke urgency.

14
00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:53.330
Whether it's a tempting offer, a dire warning,

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.282
or an intriguing question, the subject line sets

16
00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:58.654
the stage for the deception that follows.

17
00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:03.112
Urgency is a common tactic, compelling recipients to

18
00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.624
act swiftly without pausing for rational scrutiny.

19
00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:10.024
Next, the sender address poses as a familiar

20
00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:14.352
entity, exploiting trust and familiarity to lower defenses.

21
00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:17.464
Whether it's impersonating a reputable company, a trusted

22
00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:20.800
colleague, or a governmental authority, the sender address

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.944
serves as the gateway to deception, luring recipients

24
00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:26.692
into a false sense of security within the

25
00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:29.820
body of the email, persuasive language and emotional

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.124
triggers manipulate recipients into taking desired actions.

27
00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:36.820
Urgency and fear are often employed,

28
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.148
compelling recipients to click on malicious

29
00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:41.604
links or divulge sensitive information.

30
00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:45.972
By leveraging current events, cybercriminals exploit topicality to

31
00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.860
increase the relevance and credibility of their ruse,

32
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.348
making it more difficult to discern the deception

33
00:01:51.348 --> 00:01:53.844
amidst the chaos of the digital landscape.

34
00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:58.344
Furthermore, the inclusion of logos, branding, and

35
00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:01.832
imagery mimics legitimate communications, further blurring the

36
00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:04.320
line between reality and deception.

37
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.520
Recipients are lulled into a false sense

38
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.192
of security, trusting the authenticity of the

39
00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:11.104
email based on visual cues alone.
