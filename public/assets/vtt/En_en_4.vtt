00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.830
The first step of any attacker would

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.654
be to choose the perfect target.

3
00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:13.094
Now let's look at their process

4
00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:15.110
of zeroing in on a target.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.758
Demographics play a pivotal role in target selection.

6
00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:21.742
Attackers tailor their phishing campaigns to specific

7
00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:24.830
demographics, understanding that different groups may have

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.838
varying susceptibilities and behaviors online.

9
00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:31.014
Whether it's age, occupation, or geographic

10
00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:33.812
location, attackers leverage this information to

11
00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:35.804
craft more convincing lures.

12
00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:39.100
Behavior patterns provide invaluable insights into the

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.028
habits and tendencies of potential victims.

14
00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:45.076
By studying online behaviors such as browsing

15
00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:48.948
history, social media activity, or shopping preferences,

16
00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.356
attackers can tailor their approach to align

17
00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:53.916
with the targets interests and preferences.

18
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:57.076
The abundance of personal information available online

19
00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:59.844
serves as a treasure trove for attackers.

20
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:03.740
From social media profiles to publicly available databases,

21
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.060
attackers exploit this wealth of information to personalize

22
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.084
their attacks, making them more convincing and difficult

23
00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.540
to discern from legitimate communication.

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.396
Ultimately, attackers seek out individuals or organizations

25
00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.028
with weak cybersecurity practices or those who

26
00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:21.188
are more susceptible to their tricks.

27
00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:23.748
Whether it's a lack of awareness, inadequate

28
00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:26.468
security measures, or a propensity to trust

29
00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:31.108
unsolicited communications, attackers exploit vulnerabilities to maximize

30
00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:32.034
their chances of success.
