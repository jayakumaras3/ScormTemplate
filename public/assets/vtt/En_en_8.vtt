00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.702
Now that you're armed with insights

2
00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.078
about phishing, it's imperative to fortify

3
00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.678
your defenses against these digital predators.

4
00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:17.022
I'll equip you with practical strategies to

5
00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:19.662
safeguard your personal and sensitive information from

6
00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:21.614
falling into the wrong hands.

7
00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.982
Firstly, always scrutinize the legitimacy of emails

8
00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:28.518
and websites before divulging any sensitive details.

9
00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:30.136
Look out for suspicious sender

10
00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:33.152
addresses, grammatical errors, and unexpected

11
00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:34.964
requests for personal information.

12
00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:39.424
Never click on a suspicious link, only hover over

13
00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:42.024
it or press it for a long duration.

14
00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:44.120
By doing so, you can inspect the

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.528
web address by focusing on the domain.

16
00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:48.504
This stands as the simplest method

17
00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.400
to identify a phishing link.

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.992
If the domain doesn't match the

19
00:00:51.992 --> 00:00:54.044
sender, the link is suspicious.

20
00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.730
Hence, phishers endeavor to make domains and sender

21
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.774
addresses resemble each other as closely as possible.

22
00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:05.226
A web address invariably follows a uniform structure.

23
00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:08.490
The domain constitutes the final segment situated

24
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.074
just prior to the initial single slash.

25
00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:13.570
It comprises the name succeeded by a

26
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.674
period and an extension (.com or .org).

27
00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.962
The period acts as a separator in the

28
00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:22.170
name and is not considered part of it.

29
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.774
Conversely, other punctuation marks, such as dashes (-),

30
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:27.994
might well form components of the name.

31
00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:33.190
For instance, this link: Does not correspond to the

32
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.918
microsoft.com domain, but rather to micro-soft.cn!

33
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.998
Meanwhile this link: Does not pertain to the example.com

34
00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:45.430
domain but instead to log-in.org!

35
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.438
Additionally, consider implementing multifactor

36
00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:50.542
authentication wherever possible.

37
00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:53.598
This adds an extra layer of security by requiring

38
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:56.350
more than just a password to access your accounts,

39
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.974
making it significantly harder for attackers to infiltrate.

40
00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:03.598
Furthermore, staying informed about current threats is crucial

41
00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.462
in staying one step ahead of cybercriminals.

42
00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:08.645
Keep abreast of the latest phishing tactics

43
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.710
and trends, and educate yourself on how

44
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.886
to recognize and respond to suspicious activity.

45
00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.046
Lastly, don't underestimate the power

46
00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.990
of reporting phishing attempts.

47
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.868
By alerting the appropriate authorities or IT security teams,

48
00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:24.748
you not only protect yourself, but also contribute to

49
00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.884
the collective effort in combating cyber crime.

50
00:02:27.884 --> 00:02:30.492
Your vigilance could potentially prevent others from

51
00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:32.724
falling victim to the same deceptive tactics.
