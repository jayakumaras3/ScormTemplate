1
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.334
Congratulations, you have completed the course.

2
00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:13.910
A deep dive into phishing. In

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.686
this course, you have learned attackers

4
00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:20.174
leverage demographics, behavior patterns, and personal

5
00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:23.534
information online to tailor phishing campaigns.

6
00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:26.822
Phishers craft emails with familiar looking addresses,

7
00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:30.600
compelling subject lines, and persuasive content, often

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.524
including logos and branding, to deceive recipients.

9
00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:37.440
A web address typically comprises a name followed

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
by a period and extension (.com or .org), with the

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.712
domain situated just before the initial single slash.

12
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.872
The period separates the name and is not

13
00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.424
part of it, while other punctuation marks, like

14
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.804
dashes(-) may be included in the name.

15
00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:57.308
Always scrutinize emails and websites for legitimacy.

16
00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.644
Avoid clicking suspicious links, and

17
00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:01.404
stay informed about current threats.

18
00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:05.364
To strengthen cybersecurity defenses, reporting

19
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.092
phishing attempts is crucial.

20
00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:09.628
It protects you and helps combat cybercrime

21
00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:12.692
by alerting authorities, potentially preventing others from

22
00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:14.364
falling victim to similar tactics.
